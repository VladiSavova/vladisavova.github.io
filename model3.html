    <div class="p-info">
        <p class="italic">Acceleration is outstanding and instantaneous. Drivability is excellent even before you turn on the semiautomated features. The Model X can't hide its prodigious weight, but it handles like a vehicle that's 500 pounds lighter. An EV that can tow is unique, but range will be a factor.</p>

        <p class="italic">The Model X is extremely quiet and equipped with seats that are suitable for long stints. It's heavy, but it manages its weight well. The ride quality overall is good except over broken or potholed surfaces where the heavy wheels and low-profile tires show their limits.</p>

        <p class="italic">This is an SUV that's light on utility since the second-row seats do not fold and there is no provision for a roof rack. Visibility is terrific, and entry and exit are easy, though the rear doors can be infuriating. The second-row storage is lacking.

        <p class="italic">Utility takes a huge hit due to the compromised rear doors. The optional second-row captain's chairs (in the six-passenger configuration) do not fold, though the standard second-row bench does. There is no provision for a roof rack, and small-item storage is limited.</p>

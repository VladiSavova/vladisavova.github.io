        <p class="italic">The Tesla Roadster is an upcoming all-electric battery-powered four-seater sports car. It is said it will be capable of 0 to 97 km/h (0 to 60 mph) in 1.9 seconds, quicker than any street legal production car to date at its announcement in November 2017. The Roadster is the successor to Tesla's first production car, which was the 2008 Roadster.</p>

            Its claimed 0 to 400 m (0 to 1⁄4 mile) time will be under 9 seconds, with a top speed above 400 km/h (250 mph). If the production Roadster achieves these performance numbers, it will outperform the supercars of 2017 and would set new production car records, none of which had yet done better than 0–100 km/h (0–62 mph) in 2.0 seconds or 9.0 seconds in the 1/4 mile.</p>

In an article titled Tesla's Newest Promises Break the Laws of Batteries, Morsy indicated that the claimed battery capacity would require batteries that would be too large for the Roadster's small frame</p>

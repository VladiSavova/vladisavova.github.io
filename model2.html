        <p class="italic">When it was first announced in 2016, the Tesla Model 3 made headlines with a trio of talking points: 1) 0-60 mph in less than 6 seconds! 2) A range of 220 miles! 3) And all for the low, low price of $35,000! While this low-cost Model 3 didn't fully materialize until this year (and even then deducts incentives from the purchase price), we're still hugely impressed. Aside from a few ergonomic issues, the 2019 Tesla Model 3 is one of the best electric vehicles on sale today.</p>

        <p class="italic">The Model 3's trunk can hold far more than you'd expect thanks to a broad pass-through and SUV-like fold-flat rear seats. The trunk's stated capacity (15 cubic feet) isn't that impressive compared to what you get from other luxury compact sedans, but we were able to fit an extra-large mountain bike with ease.</p>

        <p class="italic">We found the Model 3 to be a pleasant place to sit, and that feeling held up for hours at a time. Our one gripe is the non-perforated leather seats; they don't breathe all that well if you're in a warmer climate. Otherwise, the seats are cushy and provide nice support.</p>

        <p class="italic">The Model 3's controversial interior design looks modern and cutting-edge. The driving position is highly adjustable and feels great, and the cabin is surprisingly roomy thanks to its minimalistic approach and all-glass roof. Forward visibility is also fantastic thanks to the lack of an engine and the corresponding low hoodline.</p>

        <p class="italic">The interior of the prototype unveiled on 21 November 2019 includes a 17-inch center display, seating for 6 using two bench seats with the front middle seat being a fold-down center arm rest, a digital rear-view camera based mirror, a race car style steering yoke, and a dashboard with a surface resembling marble</p>

        <p class="italic">The bed of the truck is 6.5 feet (2.0 m) long and similar to a conventional pickup truck bed with tailgate. It has sloped side walls and an integral motorized roller shutter style tonneau cover to improve the aerodynamics of the vehicle. Because of the additional security this provides, Tesla terms this 100-cubic-foot (2.8 m3) enclosed space "the vault". It includes LED light strips along each side, an additional under-floor storage space behind the rear wheels, </p>

        <p class="italic">The Cybertruck uses unibody construction (termed an "exoskeleton" by Tesla) like most passenger cars, rather than the body-on-frame construction which is typical of trucks, as a standard vehicle frame would conflict with the under-floor battery pack.It uses unusually thick 3 mm (1⁄8 in) 30x-series[a] cold-rolled stainless steel body panels, which cannot be stamped like conventional automobile parts</p>
